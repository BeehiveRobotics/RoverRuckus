## Beehive Robotic's Rover Ruckus season code

This is the repo for the 2018-19 FTC season, Rover Ruckus! We really wish that it was a water game this year, but oh well. 

The submodules that we use are our (Library)[https://github.com/BeehiveRobotics/Library] and our own (CV)[https://github.com/BeehiveRobotics/RoverRuckusCV], which is free for anyone to use, as long as you mention us in your presentation/control award application.
